## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This project requires a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** for all
contributions.

### Individual Contributors

If you are contributing as an individual, you must sign the
**Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)**:

- [ICLA.md](./ICLA.md)

The ICLA is signed **once** and applies to **all current and future
contributions**. A CLA check will run automatically on your first pull request.

### Contributions on Behalf of a Company

If you are contributing on behalf of an employer or other legal entity, your
company must have a signed **Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)**
on file:

- [CCLA.md](./CCLA.md)

A CCLA is signed **once per company** and covers all authorized contributors
from that company. If a contribution appears to be made on behalf of a company,
you may be asked to confirm this before the pull request is merged.

## How CLA Checks Work

This repository uses an automated CLA check:

- If you have not yet signed the required CLA, the check will fail
- You will be prompted to review and agree to the CLA
- Pull requests cannot be merged until the CLA check passes

Once signed, you will not be asked again.
